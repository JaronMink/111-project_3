Files in tarball: lab3b.py Makefile README

      lab3b.py: the python source code that produces the lab3b executable. Checks a
      csv file to assess whether an EXT2 filesystem contains inconsitencies within it.
      It checks whether blocks have been allocated properly (duplicates, unreferences, invalid),
      whether Inodes have been allocated properly (both on free list and allocated or opposite),
      and whether Directories only refer to properly allocated Inodes and their special links
      are consistent as well.

      Makefile: a makefile that allows for easy compilation and distribution of
      the program. By default, "compiles" program. With the dist option, will
      produce tarball containing all needed files. clean option will delete
      all files produced by the makefile
      Note: as the source code is python, no compliation is neccessary, thus when "compiling",
      the Makefile simply copies the python code to the new executable which can then be compiled.

      README: This file. Describes all files included.
